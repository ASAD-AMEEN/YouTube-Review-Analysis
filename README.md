# YouTube-Review-Analysis
The project involved an exploratory data analysis of a YouTube review dataset that contained various columns such as Rank, Username, Categories, Subscribers, Country, Visits, Likes, Comments, and Links.

Sampling Distribution of Sample Mean:

Analyzed the dataset by generating the sampling distribution of the sample mean. This statistical analysis helps in understanding the variability and distribution of the mean of a particular column or numerical feature.
Mean Values of Numerical Columns:

Calculated and visualized the mean values of numerical columns within the dataset. This could include means of metrics like Subscribers, Visits, Likes, and Comments. Understanding these average values gives insight into the general trends and behaviors within the dataset.
Distribution on World Map:

Plotted geographical distribution on a world map using the 'Country' column. This type of visualization helps to understand the spread of the data across different countries and regions.
Correlation Analysis:

Explored correlations between different columns to understand how they relate to each other. For example, finding correlations between Subscribers, Visits, Likes, and Comments, which helps identify any patterns or relationships within the dataset.
Predictive Modelling using Neural Networks:

Attempted predictive modeling to forecast the number of 'Likes' based on the 'Visits'. Employed neural networks to create a predictive model, despite the data not having strong predictive features. Achieved a moderate R-squared value of 0.5668491109282197, indicating that about 56.69% of the variability in 'Likes' can be explained by 'Visits'. Although the predictive power was limited, the model provided insights into the relationship between these two variables.
This analysis allowed for an in-depth understanding of the YouTube review dataset, exploring various statistical, visual, and predictive methods to gain insights and relationships within the data.
